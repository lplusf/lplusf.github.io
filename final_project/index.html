    <h1>This is Me</h1>
    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in Greenwich, CT.  I was raised in an Irish-Italian family with 2 older sisters.  We have grown to be very close over the years, I do consider them my best friends.</p>

    <h3>Teenage Years</h3>
    <p>At the age of 15, I lost my mother to cancer.  This was a very difficult time in my life, and I started to go into a downward spiral. There were a few things that I wish I could do over:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Focused more on School</li>
      <li>Cared more about myself</li>
      <li>Spent more time with my family</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Present Day</h3>
    <p>I am at a really good place in my life now.  I am working on my Masters degree and I have an awesome job.  My passion is reading and writing and I hope to one day become a famous author.</p>
